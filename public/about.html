<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi visitor,</p>
<p>
I recently graduated from Bhopal Information Technology College, where I pursued BCA (Bachelors in Computer Application). As I graduated recently, I am now looking to transition my career into web development.</p>
<p>
I am a passionate web developer with more than 3 years of work experience in the corporate world, although not in a tech role. Despite this, I have been more attracted to web development than my job role, which is why I started learning it. I have subscribed to Udemy online and started learning from there, initially not regularly but in my spare time. Over time, it has become a habit due to my keen interest in development. However, I am still learning, and this will be my first portfolio project.</p>
<p>
During my overall experience, I worked with domestic and international clients in the telecommunications industry. Working in teams has proven that I am a very good team player. I am well-versed in corporate culture, and working with international clients has honed my communication skills. This demonstrates my capability to effectively communicate with clients. I had the opportunity to work with Revolute as a fincrime analyst and with Meta as a content moderator or social media policy specialist. However, both roles were non-tech backgrounds, which diminished my interest in them. Hence, I opted to pursue my passion for web development.</p>
